    <h2 style="color:red;">why electric motorcycles are kind of stupid</h2>
    <h3 style="color:white;">they aren't cars</h3>
    <p style="color:white;">i built an electric motorcycle and its kind of cool and also kind of stupid. i took a 1971 honda cl175 and took an angle grinder to it, and then did some other stuff to make it run on a big battery instead of gasoline. it turns out there's this thing called air resistance that you're not allowed to ignore in real life, and it makes going fast when you're not aerodynamic very inefficient. the energy density of batteries isn't as good as gasoline so electric vehicles gotta be aerodynamic to go at interesting speeds for useful lengths of time. cars can be very aerodynamic, but motorcycles generally aren't.
